#### Topic 2. [2-1. Physical Ergonomics I: Biomechanics]
Watch the [videos listed in **2-1. Physical Ergonomics I**](HFE02_1.md), then write an essay including the following subtopics.<br><br>
Biomechanics is a specific domain under HF/E. Did you search `#biomechanics` in Google's image search? You might see lots of images related to the skeleton and muscle of the human body. Yes, biomechanics is a domain related to the movement and posture of living creatures. We move (e.g., walking, running, dancing, standing work at a factory, sitting for desk work, playing sports, holding heavy stuff, controlling keyboard and mouse, touching smartphone) by controlling our muscles.

First, set a target user (e.g., normal adults, ladies/gentlemen seeking a fit suit, fast-grwoing children, weakened elderly people, disabled people, ...). You may search some existing products with keywords including `#anthropometric design`, `#3d body scanning`, `#3d human shape`, `#digital human modeling`, `#human body size`, `#human body shape`, `#prosthetics`, etc.

- **Subtopic 3**: Provide your own idea of a new product or service, which can make people in good, safe, and healthy posture (at industry/office workplaces, at home, at a hospital, at school, or at other particular places).

	- Understanding the human brain and cognitive process
	- What is IPM?
	- Key concepts of IPM
		- (1) sensation/perception
		- (2) attention (divided attention & selective attention)
		- (3) memory (short-term memory and long-term memory)
	- Could people focus on many things at the same time? (about multi-taking)

	- What is the user-centered design in terms of the IPM?
	- Why the cognitive health is the matter? (if cognitively unhealthy, what happened?)
	- How to improve cognitive health?

- **Subtopic 2**: Explain the process of human behavior (for example, learning HF/E, taking an exam, decision making for dinner, playing basketball, find a restaurant, plan a trip, plan a birthday event, ...) using the IPM. What information is processed through sensory memory, short-term memory (= working memory), and long-term memory while doing the chosen task, and how? Draw an IPM chart to explain the chosen task. (No perfect answer is required. You will try to explain the IPM several times more in this course.)

- **Subtopic 3**: Provide your own idea of a new product (e.g., device, smartphone app, service platform, ...), which can increase information processing performance such as focusing/attention, better memorization, faster and more accurate calculation, reasonable comparison, and so forth.

	- What is 'fight or flight'?
	- What is cognitive workload?
	- How to manage cognitive load (or say, stress)?

- **Subtopic 2**: 
From the knowledge about 'fight or flight response', you might get ideas on how our physiological status can be technically explained based on bio-signals. Human bio-signals are broadly used to recognize the physical, cognitive, and emotional status of people. Here are some example.
	(1) `#ECG`, `#EEG`, `#eye movement`, `#body temperature`, `#skin conductance`, ... can tell whether we are nervous/afraid or not.
	(2) ECG, body temperature, and eye movement data can tell if a driver is drowsy while driving. 
	(3) A smartwatch (or any other wearable device) can catch if a person seems in abnormal status.<br><br>
**Question**: Then, what other cases do you know about sensing human bio-signals to help people to manage their stresses or workloads? Or you may provide your idea(s) on the use of human bio-signals for managing cognitive stress or workloads.

- **Subtopic 3**: Look around. Find any product or app or its interfaces, which easily make people causing an error (e.g., wrong decision making, wrong perception, wrong calculation, misunderstand, mistake, slip, failure, memory lapse, ...). If you find a case, provide your ideas (with some sketches) on how to fix it to reduce human error.


#### Topic 6. [4-1. Emotional Ergonomics I: Emotional Engineering, Measurement of Human Emotion]

- **Subtopic 2**: In the session of cognitive ergonomics II (related to 'fight or flight response'), we had learned how the human bio-signals show the physical, cognitive, and emotional status of people. Continued from that, this time, let's think about human emotion by the engineer's perspective. What ideas do you have, which is about how emotional engineering could be useful for students' life at Handong University? (related keywords to this question: `#neuroscience`, `#neuromarketing`, `#Brain-Computer Interaction`, `#affective engineering`, `#UX engineering`, ...)

- **Subtopic 3**: AI/robot technologies are getting rapidly developed. Let's suppose that the AI can perfectly measure human emotions based on our bio-signals, facial recognition, and behavior analysis; also emotionally responses to you like a real human (based on computer algorithms, of course!). What are positive and negative thoughts of your about a computer/device/robot's emotional reaction to you? (Did you perhaps watch the movie, 'Her'?) Provide your arguments/opinion that what are positive/negative effects of the human-like robot/computer in people's daily life.

- **Subtopic 2**: How can human emotion affect human behavior? Let's think about some good or bad examples on which emotion can make people doing good actions or hesitating. How can a design help people have a good emotional status? (keyword: `#positive emotion`, `#positive design`)

- **Subtopic 3**: How do you think about the power of positivity? Get this [Design for Happiness Cardset](https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid:22a4e066-a1ab-468c-bd78-6c2c3e39e064/datastream/OBJ/download) by clicking the link. Then, by referring to the keywords (e.g., `#amusement`, `#confidence`, `#courage`, `#dreaminess`, `#energetic`, `#fascination`, `#hope`, `#joy`, `#kindness`, `#love`, `#pride`, `#satisfaction`, ...) showing in the cardset, provide some ideas on how to make people being more positive by a new product/service. (For example, how to make people amused?)


#### Topic 8. [5-1. Usability I: Design with Users & Usability Evaluation]
Watch the [videos listed in **5-1 Usability Engineering I**](HFE05_1.md), then write an essay including the following subtopics.

- **Subtopic 1. Summary**: Summarize what you've learned from the videos. You can use "bullet points" to list important concepts in short sentences. Here are important questions of this topic. Don't exceed one page for a summary.

- **Subtopic 2**: The USER needs to be importantly considered in product development. Why? What can be happened if the USER (e.g., their needs/wants, their working environment/situation, their physical/cognitive/emotional characteristics, ...) is not appropriately considered in a <font color="blue">product</font> development process? What are the benefits of involving users in the product/service development process? There are many reasons/aspects, which might result in a product successful or fail. How is 'usability' important for the product's success? Do you know any success or failure story? (keywords: `#user-centered design`, `#design with users`, `#co-design`, `#usability`, `#usability evaluation`)<br><font color="blue">(Note) "product" mentioned in this question widely includes various types of the produced things such as ICT devices, home appliances, crafts, meals, designs, equipment, facility, buildings, home, interior, software, smartphone app, ...</font>

- **Subtopic 3**: How to know about the user? There are many methods and ways of having a connection to users. Explain some methods of how to meet users. Also, describe the usability (use + ability) and usability testing (or usability evaluation). How is usability evaluation different from the user needs survey?


#### Topic 9. [5-2. Usability  II: User-Centered Design Principles]
Watch the [videos listed in **5-2 Usability Engineering II**](HFE05_2.md), then write an essay including the following subtopics.

- **Subtopic 1. Summary**: Summarize what you've learned from the videos. You can use "bullet points" to list important concepts in short sentences. Here are important questions of this topic. Don't exceed one page for a summary.

- **Subtopic 2**: Based on the knowledge of "INCLUSIVE DESIGN", discuss how HUMAN is different from USER. (in other words, how can you distinguish differences between "HUMAN-centered" and "USER-centered")

- **Subtopic 3**: Everybody knows that user-centered design is important. And UCD is one of the success factors in business. But, how-to-design is a different story. There are general guidelines for the user-centered design (e.g., `#simplicity`, `#affordance`, `#mapping`, `#consistency`, `#flexibility`, `#structure`, `#constraints`, `#tolerance`, `#feedback`, ...), but the specific considerations are all different by product. Provide different examples (two or three), which require different considerations for the increment of own usability.
