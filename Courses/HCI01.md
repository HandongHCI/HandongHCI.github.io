## Human-Computer Interaction (SIT22008)

### 1. Introduction to HCI

From this series of videos, you might have a broad understanding of the concept of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), related technologies, and application domains. Also, the videos would open your ideas on HCI. I hope you are getting more and more interested in studying HCI.

Most of the videos I provide, some are gotten from an [online HCI course of GeorgiaTech shared via Udacity](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud400/). I highly recommend you to enroll in GeorgiaTech's course. In that course, you could have a broader understanding of not only the `concept of HCI`, but also `design principles`, `user research methods`, `design process`, `prototyping and evaluation`, and more theoretical information.

But in my HCI course, some theories including `understanding of human`, `design method and process`, `user study`, `ideation and prototyping` are NOT taught, but delivered in my other coursed (e.g., Human Factors and Ergonomics, Product Planning and Development, Ideation and Prototyping). My HCI course is more focusing on practice and project, besides the theories.

If any student who feels a lack of understanding about the theoretical part of HCI, I recommend to take [the online course that GeorgiaTech provides via Udacity](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud400/).

<br><br><br>

Before we start the course, let's watch some show cases about HCI.

- Where we are now? (2018)

- Samsung at CES 2021 (in 9 minutes): We are now almost here.

(if you want to see the full video of this?: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqXsTtW5VEo. Also, look into the CES 2021, then you may find a lot of interesting HCIs, which can put on your hands VERY SOON!)

<br><br><br>

So, what can you see from the videos above? How can computers make our life more convenient/comfortable? How can we make computers more helpful for people? How can interactive technologies support us to live healthy and safe in the changing world (e.g., COVID-19)?



#### [Video Lectures]

**A. Introduction to HCI**

- What is HCI?
	- [click here and find a video and articles about HCI](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/human-computer-interaction)

- The birth of HCI
<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; padding-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 50px; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ar9Jzl3r0gc" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>

- The history and future of HCI
<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; padding-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 50px; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t_ZzhadA3DY" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>

	- [Brief Introduciton to HCI](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/book/the-encyclopedia-of-human-computer-interaction-2nd-ed/human-computer-interaction-brief-intro)
<br><br><br>

(No worries! I will also provide my short lecture about 'What is HCI?' in the class.)



**B. HCI Technologies**

From here, you will need to follow the instruction below to take the necessary lectures.
1. Go to [GeorgiaTech's HCI lecture provided by Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/human-computer-interaction--ud400)
2. Join Udacity & Sign-in
3. Start the course
![HCI course in Udacity](img/Udacity_HCI.png)
4. Go to **1.3: Exploring HCI (LESSON 3)** and take the following lessons provided via Udacity.
	- HCI Technology: Virtual Reality
	- HCI Technology: Augmented Reality
	- HCI Technology: UbiComp and Wearables
	- HCI Technology: Robotics
	- HCI Technology: Mobile

Of course, most (or all) computer technologies are related to HCI, as the `HCI` means the interaction (or relation) between humans and any kind of `computers`.

Q. "What are computers, then?"
A. (You will need to answer this question in the 2nd essay assignment.)
<br><br><br>


**C. Related Domains of HCI**

Also, take the following lessons provided in **1.3: Exploring HCI**.
	- Domain: Special Needs
	- Domain: Education
	- Domain: Healthcare
	- Domain: Security
	- Domain: Games

In this course, you will have to think how computers can help/support (or interact with) people, especially in terms of the following domains.
- Home & Human Life
- Healthcare & Safety
- Education & Work
- Smart City
- Transportation
<br><br><br>


**D. HCI Ideas**

Again, take the following lessons provided in **1.3: Exploring HCI**.
	- Idea: Context-Sensitive Computing
	- Idea: Gesture-Based Interaction
	- Idea: Pen- and Touch-Based Interaction
	- Idea: Information Visualization
	- Idea: CSCW
	- Idea: Social Computing

Those ideas are just small examples. You would get more ideas from the next series of videos: [2. HCI Applications and Case Studies](HCI02.md). You have to have some ideas quickly for the term project in this course.
<br><br><br>
