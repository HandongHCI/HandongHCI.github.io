### Topics

#### Topic 1. [The First Essay]
Write the first essay including the follow subtopics.

- **Subtopic 1. Introduction to yourself**: Say something about yourself. What do you study in Handong? Why do you want to take this course? What do you expect to learn from this course? Is there anything that you'd like to say to the professor?

- **Subtopic 2. What is the 'human factors and ergonomics'?**: What do you know about HF/E? Search a web a little bit to find one or two examples called 'ergonomic product' or 'human-centered product'. Why is the product human-centered? Which features of the product are making the product more human-friendly? What core values the target users might earn when they use the product?

- **Subtopic 3. Any other idea?** Look around you. What products can you find around you? Do you see any product that is not user-friendly designed to provide unsatisfactory or bad user experiences to users? Find any product that could be improved to be more user-friendly. And provide ideas on how to improve it for which values to deliver to users.


#### Topic 2. [2-1. Physical Ergonomics I: Biomechanics]
Watch the [videos listed in **2-1. Physical Ergonomics I**](HFE02_1.md), then write an essay including the following subtopics.<br><br>
Biomechanics is a specific domain under HF/E. Did you search `#biomechanics` in Google's image search? You might see lots of images related to the skeleton and muscle of the human body. Yes, biomechanics is a domain related to the movement and posture of living creatures. We move (e.g., walking, running, dancing, standing work at a factory, sitting for desk work, playing sports, holding heavy stuff, controlling keyboard and mouse, touching smartphone) by controlling our muscles.

- **Subtopic 1. Summary**: Summarize what you've learned from the videos. You might use bullet points for listing keywords and short items. Don't exceed one page for a summary.

- **Subtopic 2**: How can the knowledge of biomechanics help people in our daily life? To be helped your understanding about this subtopic, remind the following keywords: `#biomechanics`, `musculoskeletal system`, `#motion capture`, `#human motion`, `#human movement`, `#EMG`, `#bionics`, `#exoskeleton`, `#occupational biomechanics`, `#sports science`. For example, the keywords `EMG` and `bionics` can explain how our muscle signal (as a bio-data) is applied for the use of bionic prosthesis.

- **Subtopic 3**: Provide your own idea of a new product or service, which is based on human biomechanical data (e.g., motion data, EMG data) for general or specific target users. Provide detailed features of your idea. Also, provide figures or sketches of your idea if possible.


#### Topic 3. [2-2. Physical Ergonomics II: Anthropometry, Ergonomics at Workplace, Virtual Ergonomics]
Watch the [videos listed in **2-2. Physical Ergonomics II**](HFE02_2.md), then write an essay including the following subtopics.

- **Subtopic 1. Summary**: Summarize what you've learned from the videos. You might use bullet points for listing keywords and short items. Don't exceed one page for a summary.

- **Subtopic 2**: How can the knowledge of anthropometry (which means measurement of human body) and 3D body scanning help people in our daily life? Try to search some existing products with keywords including `anthropometric design`, `3d body scanning`, `3d human shape`, `digital human modeling`, `human body size`, `human body shape`, etc.

- **Subtopic 3**: Provide your own idea of a new product or service, which can make people in good, safe, and healthy posture (at industry/office workplaces, at home, at a hospital, at school, or at other particular places). Provide detailed features of your idea. Also, provide figures or sketches of your idea if possible.


#### Topic 4. [3-1. Cognitive Ergonomics I: Information Processing Model]
Watch the [videos listed in **3-1. Cognitive Ergonomics I**](HFE03_1.md), then write an essay including the following subtopics.

- **Subtopic 1. Summary**: Summarize what you've learned from the videos. You might use bullet points for listing keywords and short items. Don't exceed one page for a summary.

- **Subtopic 2**: Explain the process of something (for example, learning, taking an exam, decision making, playing basketball, find a restaurant, plan a trip, plan an birthday event, ...) using the IPM. What information is processed through the sensory memory, short-term memory (= working memory), and long-term memory, and how? Draw an IPM chart to explaining the chosen task.

- **Subtopic 3**: Provide your own idea of a new product or service, which can increase information processing performance such as focusing/attention, better memorization, faster and more accurate calculation, reasonable comparison, and so forth.

#### Topic 5. [3-2. Cognitive Ergonomics II: Human error, cognitive training, and fight or flight response]
Watch the [videos listed in **3-2 Cognitive Ergonomics II**](HFE03_2.md), then write an essay including the following subtopics.

- **Subtopic 1. Summary**: Summarize what you've learned from the videos. You might use bullet points for listing keywords and short items. Don't exceed one page for a summary.

- **Subtopic 2**: How can knowledge about 'fight or flight response' (= change of human physiological status by cognitive activities) help people in their daily life? Self-search some existing products measure human bio-signals to understand the physical, cognitive, and emotional status of people (example of search keywords: ECG, EEG, eye tracking, body temperature, skin conductance).

- **Subtopic 3**: Look around. What kind of product or software can you find, which makes people causing the human error (e.g., wrong decision making, wrong perception, wrong calculation, mistake, slip, failure, memory lapse, ...). And provide some ideas on how to fix it to reduce human errors.


#### Topic 6. [4-1. Emotional Ergonomics I: Emotional Engineering, Measurement of Human Emotion]
Watch the [videos listed in **4-1 Emotional Ergonomics I**](HFE04_1.md), then write an essay including the following subtopics.

- **Subtopic 1. Summary**: Summarize what you've learned from the videos. You might use bullet points for listing keywords and short items. Don't exceed one page for a summary.

- **Subtopic 2**: In the session of cognitive ergonomics II (related to 'fight or flight response'), we had learned how the human bio-signals show the physical, cognitive, and emotional status of people. Continued from that, this time, let's think about human emotion by the engineering perspective. This time, provide your ideas on how emotional engineering could be useful in Handong. (related keywords: neuroscience, neuromarketing, Brain-Computer Interaction, affective engineering, UX engineering, ...)

- **Subtopic 3**: AI/robot technology is getting rapidly developed. Let's suppose that AI can perfectly measure human emotions using our bio-signals and facial recognition, also emotionally response (by a computer algorithm, of course) to you like a real human. What is your positive and/or negative opinion about a computer/device/robot's emotional reaction to you? (Did you perhaps watch the movie, 'Her'?) Provide your thoughts that what are positive and negative effects of the human-like robot/computer in people' daily life.
