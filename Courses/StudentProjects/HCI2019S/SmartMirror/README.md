## 1. Background & objective 
Nowadays many people spend much time on the mirror perfecting their looks. As a result they end up being late to do other stuff. The Smart Mirror helps to solve this problem by offering information which gives a head start towards the day. Many people use smartphone or computer to check their daily information. However, it is not easy to check various inforamtion at once. This mirror will help the users to check information while doing any other job. Smart mirror is a small computer with Raspberry Pi. As it is easily modifialbe, we can display our necessary infomation for users.

7. Select your Application type as Other and submit. (Before or After that, you might be asked for making consent screen. do that.)  
8. Then, you can download your credential json file from list. Downloaded file name would be client_secret_xxxx...xxx.json. rename it as credentials.json and save it to your MMM-AssistantMk2 directory.  
9. Then, type the following code:  
```
cd ~/MagicMirror/modules/MMM-AssistantMk2/
node auth_and_test.js
```
10. internet explore will open soon, then log in to the google and copy the code that appear on the screen and paste on the terminal.
11. if you see "Type your request" on the screen, type

...
```
15. Remember the id    
16. Now set your config.js    
You can chage the size of you photos and speed of slide and so on...


### 3.8. Install remote control
You can control your smarmirror modules on your smartphone.  
Automatic installation  
```
bash -c "$(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jopyth/MMM-Remote-Control/master/installer.sh)"
```
Updates  
```
cd ~/MagicMirror/modules/MMM-Remote-Control # adapt directory if you are using a different one
git pull
npm install # install (new) dependencies
```
change address and whitelist
For security reasons, the MagicMirror (and therefore the Remote Control) is not reachable externally. To change this, configure address, and ipWhitelist in your config.js (see these lines in the sample config). For example change address to ```0.0.0.0```. You can add allawable IP addresses to the whitelist or just leave itself to allow many devices.
```
address : '0.0.0.0',
    port: 8080,
    ipWhitelist: ["127.0.0.1", "::ffff:127.0.0.1", "::1", "::ffff:192.168.0.42", "::ffff:192.168.0.50"],"
```

## 4. Source code  
- Installation of Raspberry Pi : https://www.raspberrypi.org/  
- Installation of modules : https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror  
- Installation of modules from 3rd party : https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror/wiki/3rd-party-modules  

## 5. Limitation
- YouTube is incompatible with the smart mirror module
- Mic sensors are not working properly
- Google Assistants is not working as smooth as on the smart phone
- Some APIs are not working well with the Raspberry Pi and SmartMirror

## 6. Future plan
1. Enabling to control modulse with voice command  
2. Installing the body sensor  
3. Enabling the touch screen  
4. Connect home devices to google home to control home devices
5. connect some health applications to the mirror

## 7. Conclusion
Raspberry PI is not so expensive and anyone can easily access to the open sources on the Internet. This mirror is easily modifiable and customizable. Therefore, anyone can make their own custom made smart mirror to make their life more convenient and enthusiastic.
