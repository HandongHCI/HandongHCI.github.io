## Human Factors and Ergonomics (SIT22008)

### 1. Introduction to HF/E

Okay, I start this course with some questions. Are you ready to answer?
- How do you describe the definition of human factors and ergonomics (in short, HF/E)?
- Another question. What is human-centered design?
- And how is HF/E related to human-centered design?
- How to make a product (including software) with which considerations about human or user?
- To be detailed, what are the physical, cognitive, and emotional characteristics of humans?
- What (bio-) data (which human keeps producing every moment) could be used in designing a product or a service?

Well.. You might not want to answer this now, right? But, you will need to be available to answer those questions at the end of this course. And I know you can. 

Through the course, you will get familiar with the concept of HF/E. And you will surely have a new perspective of the world and human being after you finish to take this course. You will also acquire a fundamental philosophy about 'how to make/design a product' for successful business in a market.

Today, let's get brief understaning about HF/E.

Are you ready to learn about the human?
