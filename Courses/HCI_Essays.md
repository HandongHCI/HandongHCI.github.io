### Topics

#### Topic 1. [The First Essay]
Write the first essay including the following subtopics.

- **Subtopic 1. Introduction to yourself**: Say something about yourself. What do you study in Handong? Why do you want to take this course? What do you expect to learn from this course? Is there anything that you'd like to say to the professor?

- **Subtopic 2. What is the 'human-computer interaction'?**: What do you know about HCI? Find one or two examples of human-computer interaction that you are interested in. Also, please provide what kind of HCI product/app/system do you want to build through the course project?


#### Topic 2. [Introduction to HCI]
Watch the [videos listed in **1. Introduction to HCI**](HCI01.md), then write an essay including the following subtopics.

- **Subtopic 1. Summary**: Summarize what you've learned from the videos.

- **Subtopic 2. Explain what is "interaction"**: Look back on your daily life and find how you live a day. You surely live a day with having a relationship with other people, also with using lots of products. Yes, you are keeping interacting with someone and something around you. Even you are now indirectly interacting with prof. Lee, by reading this article and understanding his assignment. Reading a book is an interaction/communication with the author of the book, even it was written in the 1800s. Watching a movie is also an interaction with filmmakers of that movie. KakaoTalk, e-mail, driving, smartphone game, taking a course, listening to music, having dinner with your family, ... all is worked based on a concept of "interaction". Genesis chapter 1, God created heaven and earth, and his created human, then immediately started to interact with his creature. Interaction is an essential action of living beings. **SO, my question is "how do you interact with your family, with your friends and colleagues, with your mobile phone and computer, with other devices/object around you, with God (if you have Christianity), and with any other target that you need to interact with?" This question is asking you to explain what is the philosophy of interaction and how interaction is working in our daily life.** (Answering this question is very important in this course. You will learn about HCI and do a term-project through this semester while you are searching for your own answer to the question that "What is good interaction? How to develop a product/software/app for better human life?")


#### Topic 3. [HCI Applications and Case Studies]
Watch the [videos listed in **2. Examples of HCI Application**](HCI02.md), then write an essay including the following subtopics.

- **Subtopic 1. What would you like to make in this course?**: You surely have watched a lot of HCI examples and student projects from the listed videos. You will also build something very interesting through this semester in the HCI course. **What HCI product would you like to make in this course with your team?** Then, let's imagine more in detail. **What is the goal/purpose of what you'd like to make?** =Why do you want to make that? **Who will be the target user of your product? What do you need to achieve your goal?** et cetera. Including these questions, provide your detailed plans for the project. (BUT, I'm not sure if you can actually execute the project in this course or not.)

- (there's no other subtopics)


#### Topic 4. [Home & Human Life]
Watch the [videos listed in **3. Home & Human Life**](HCI03.md), then write an essay including the following subtopics.

- **Subtopic 1. Core values?**: After watching the series of videos about Home & Human Life, you might have insights and inspirations on how you will live your future life (individual and family life) with smart techs and HCI products. The question is **"What kind of values people may want to get from services provided by those devices?"** Explain in detail about the **core values that human can receive** by interactive technologies. Maybe it's very good if you give some examples about which product/service can provide what kind of benefits to whom (certain target users). Here I give you some keywords to help your brainstorming: convenience, comfort, health, safety, efficiency, fun, satisfaction, family reunion, happy evening, love each other, ...

- **Subtopic 2. Your ideas?**: Provide some new HCI ideas about home and human life, which can much increase values for people, individuals, and families in their daily lives. Put your sketch or illustration if available.


#### Topic 5. [Healthcare & Safety]
Watch the [videos listed in **4. Healthcare & Safety**](HCI04.md), then write an essay including the following subtopics.

- **Subtopic 1. Core values?**: The selected videos are showing various cases of how computer technologies can help people in different situations. Don't just get information about technologies and products themselves, but try to catch how the interaction between human and computer works. In this series of videos (Healthcare & Safety), find **what values people could earn from the interactive technologies related to healthcare and safety.** And explain **which aspects could make people healthy and safe.** (Here, I give some keywords about the "aspects" you might have: *clear communication, right information, accuracy, fast enough, accessibility to necessary data, appropriate alarming*, ... In the design of HCI applications, it is important to consider what values people would receive.)

- **Subtopic 2. Your ideas?**: Here now, all over the world is facing a serious problem with COVID 19, an infectious virus. You might have some ideas on such as a device, facility, hospital environment/interior, personal protective equipment, software/app showing visual data about any useful information, and so forth, which could support people in health and safety from COVID 19. **Provide your HCI idea(s) that can be helpful to overcome COVID 19. Then, explain in detail how the suggested item interacts with people. Try to visualize (e.g., draw some sketches) your idea.**


#### Topic 6. [Education & Work]
Watch the [videos listed in **5. Education & Work**](HCI05.md), then write an essay including the following subtopics.

- **Subtopic 1. Core values?**: All the learning is resulted based on some kind of the interactive activities. Reading, watching videos, discussion, presentation, practice, participation in an exhibition or a conference, ... we learn through various types of interactions. Among those different types, some activities (such as reading a book, watching a video) are indirect between learner and teacher, while discussion or presentation is the more direct way of interaction between learner and teacher (or between learners). First, **explain how the quality of interaction affects the quality of education**. And the follow-up question is **"what is the meaning of 'good quality of interaction' in education?".** Based on your learning experiences this semester, try to compare **what are the benefits and disadvantages of online lecture in terms of interaction**(e.g., conducting of interactive activities between students in the same course, way of interaction with the professor, communication in a project team)?

- **Subtopic 2. Your ideas?**: Continued from the questions above, then **what new ideas about the interaction for (online and/or offline) education do you have**? Try to make some ideas based on your good or bad experiences of learning and study. **What kind of interactions can help people to learn or work efficiently? How can computer-assistive technologies support people having disabilities to learn or work in a good way?**


#### Topic 7. [Smart City]
Watch the [videos listed in **6. Smart City**](HCI06.md), then write an essay including the following subtopics.

- **Subtopic 1. Core values?**: The population increases; cities are getting bigger and more complex; and we meet lots of problems to solve. What problems have we had? How have technologies used to solve the problems in the cities? And what could be HCI's role? <br><br>
The major issues that most cities have are: traffic problems, crimes, high prices of commodities, pollution, housing, energy supply, medical and educational cares, and so on. To solve these problems, we use computer technologies. In this era, people use **smartphones to handle the information to overcome the issues**. Here are examples of smartphone apps: map and navigation, bus/subway scheduler, mobile shopping, sales/coupons information, mobile learning, car sharing, news watching, information searching, weather alarm, ... which help people live conveniently in the crowded city. **To answer this question, first find examples of smartphone apps (or smart devices) that help people live in the city smartly. Then, explain 'what benefits people want to earn while they are living in the city'.** For example, people want to move quickly, easily, and conveniently from here to there during the rush hours. Or people want to get quality information to decide where to live with considerations of public transportation, housing price, and conveniences nearby. **And then, the following questions are 'what are HCI's roles for people in the city' and 'how people interact with others, with service providers, with systems,  and with various components/elements in the city'.** 

- **Subtopic 2. Your ideas?**: Still, there are lots of issues to be solved. What problems in the city are you interested in and do you want to care most? (for example, traffic-related problem? parking places? too many cars? pollution? high price for housing? low-birth-rate problem? slum area?) **Give your HCI idea(s) that can help to improve the qaulity of city life.** Also, exaplain **why that idea can helpful and valuable to people.**


#### Topic 8. [Transportation]
Watch the [videos listed in **7. Transportation**](HCI07.md), then write an essay including the following subtopics.

- **Subtopic 1. Core values?**: The technology of transportation has enormously advanced since the first steam-powered car was created in 18c. The car in the past was a heave mechanical box that consists of lots of bolts, nuts, and gears; but the vehicles now became a computer with wheels that consists of chips and circuit boards. That means, the vehicles are the "C" of the HCI; and people interacts with the vehicles (as "C") every day. (so called 'human-vehicle interaction')<br><br>
Let's think about how we are interacting with the vehicles and/or transportation systems. What information do we get from the vehicles and how we use them? For example, what we do in a car as a driver? Not only driving but also drivers need to control lots of interfaces (e.g., air-conditioner, radio/media, navigator). As the car has more computer functions, drivers need to know more about how to interact with the car. Then, drivers might be distracted and uneasy to focus on the primary task, which is driving.<br><br>
Engineers have struggled with the development of good in-vehicle interfaces and interactions for many decades. But, lastly, they decided not to struggle with consideration of driver's tasks; and started to work on 'self-driving cars' in which driver don't need to focus on their primary task (= driving) anymore. The self-driving car will change our life a lot in the near future. Let's imagine the world with fully autonomous vehicles on the roads; and there will be no drivers in the city! **What benefits could you expect to earn when people use self-driving cars every day? What will you do in the self-driving car?**<br><br>
Not only personal vehicles, but let's also think about public transportations and transportation systems. For example, we use the smartphone for many things related to traveling, including checking subway/bus schedule, making a reservation, renting SOCAR, buying a KTX ticket, calling a taxi, searching where to go and how to move, planning a journey, and lots of things we do with our smartphones. Can you recognize how you interact with your smartphone or with a transportation system through your smartphone? **Which values do the computerized transportation systems provide you?** One idea of mine is that it's so convenient as I don't need to wait in line to buy a ticket at a station.

- **Subtopic 2. Your ideas?**: Do you think the current in-vehicle systems provide good (= user-centered) interfaces and interactions? If not, what idea do you have to improve the current interfaces and interactions better? Be careful that the most important consideration of the vehicle design is SAFETY! So, your idea should not distract driving.<br><br>
Also, make some ideas of smartphone app that provides a useful service related to travelling, using public transportation, ....


#### Topic 9. [Ethics and Philosophies]
Watch the [videos listed in **8. Ethics and Philosophies**](HCI08.md), then write an essay including the following subtopics.

- **Subtopic 1**: This is the last topic of HCI-related essay writings. Above all the videos, the documentary films of KBS is highly recommended to watch (it's a Korean documentary film, and there are no English subtitles).<br><br>
Because we are the engineers who (will) use technologies as a tool at work, first, we should know about what we handle. Technologies can make somebody killed, or people's minds destroyed, but also it can make people in love, peace, and joyful. **What is your opinion on technology's double-sidedness? How do you want to use your computer (or any other technical) skills? For what to create? What kind of interaction do you want to design (as an idea), which can make people being happy? What is a good technology, and what is a good H-C interaction?**


#### Topic 10. Epilog
Please share how you have studied in this course, also how you have worked in the team. What did you learn about HCI? What else have you earned from the contents and activities of this class? What experiences have you gotten in the course? How did you achieve your initial goal? How your experiences and knowledge you've gotten through the course can help your study or career?
