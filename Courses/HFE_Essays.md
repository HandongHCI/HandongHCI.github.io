	- What is HF/E?
	- Remarkable examples of 'ergonomic' or 'user-centered' products.
	- What makes a product user-centered? (characteristics/features of user-centered products)
	- What values we might get when we use user-friendly product? (effects of HF/E in our daily life)

- **Subtopic 3. Good and bed examples around us** Look around you. What products/software can you find? Do you see any products that provide better user-friendly experiences. Also, find any other products that are not user-friendly designed so that it provides unsatisfactory or bad experiences to users?

Watch the [videos listed in **2-1. Physical Ergonomics I**](HFE02_1.md), then write an essay including the following subtopics.<br><br>
Biomechanics is a specific domain under HF/E. Did you search `#biomechanics` in Google's image search? You might see lots of images related to the skeleton and muscle of the human body. Yes, biomechanics is a domain related to the movement and posture of living creatures. We move (e.g., walking, running, dancing, standing work at a factory, sitting for desk work, playing sports, holding heavy stuff, controlling keyboard and mouse, touching smartphone) by controlling our muscles.

- **Subtopic 1. Summary**: Summarize what you've learned from the videos. Use "bullet points" for listing important keywords and short sentences. Don't exceed one page for a summary.

- **Subtopic 2**: How can the knowledge of biomechanics help people in our daily life? To be helped your understanding about this subtopic, remind the following keywords: `#biomechanics`, `#musculoskeletal system`, `#motion capture`, `#human motion`, `#human movement`, `#EMG`, `#bionics`, `#exoskeleton`, `#occupational biomechanics`, `#sports science`. For example, the keywords `EMG` and `bionics` can explain how our muscle signal (as a bio-data) is applied for the use of bionic prosthesis.

- **Subtopic 3**: Provide your own idea of a new product or service, which is based on human biomechanical data (e.g., motion data, EMG data) for general or specific target users. Provide detailed features of your idea. Also, provide figures or sketches of your idea if possible.

What information is processed through sensory memory, short-term memory (= working memory), and long-term memory while doing the chosen task, and how? Draw an IPM chart to explaining the chosen task. (No perfect answer is required. Students will try to explain the IPM several times more during the course.)

- **Subtopic 3**: Provide your own idea of a new product or service, which can increase information processing performance such as focusing/attention, better memorization, faster and more accurate calculation, reasonable comparison, and so forth.


#### Topic 5. [3-2. Cognitive Ergonomics II: Human error, cognitive training, and fight or flight response]
Watch the [videos listed in **3-2 Cognitive Ergonomics II**](HFE03_2.md), then write an essay including the following subtopics.

- **Subtopic 1. Summary**: Summarize what you've learned from the videos. Use "bullet points" for listing important keywords and short sentences. Don't exceed one page for a summary.

- **Subtopic 2**: 
From the knowledge about 'fight or flight response', you might get ideas on how our physiological status can be technically explained based on bio-signals. Human bio-signals are broadly used to recognize the physical, cognitive, and emotional status of people. For examples, (1) `#ECG`, `#EEG`, `#eye movement`, `#body temperature`, `#skin conductance`, ... can tell whether we are nervous/afraid or not. (2) ECG, body temperature, and eye movement data can tell if a driver is drowsy while driving or not. Or (3) a smartwatch (or any other wearable devices) can catch if a person seems in normal or abnormal status.<br><br>**Question**: What other cases do you know about the human bio-signals and its applicability for assisting people?

- **Subtopic 3**: Look around. Find any product or app or its interfaces, which easily make people causing an error (e.g., wrong decision making, wrong perception, wrong calculation, misunderstand, mistake, slip, failure, memory lapse, ...). If you find a case, please provide your idea(s) on how to fix it to reduce human error.


#### Topic 6. [4-1. Emotional Ergonomics I: Emotional Engineering, Measurement of Human Emotion]
Watch the [videos listed in **4-1 Emotional Ergonomics I**](HFE04_1.md), then write an essay including the following subtopics.

- **Subtopic 1. Summary**: Summarize what you've learned from the videos. Use "bullet points" for listing important keywords and short sentences. Don't exceed one page for a summary.

- **Subtopic 2**: In the session of cognitive ergonomics II (related to 'fight or flight response'), we had learned how the human bio-signals show the physical, cognitive, and emotional status of people. Continued from that, this time, let's think about human emotion by the engineer's perspective. What ideas do you have, which is about how emotional engineering could be useful for students' life at Handong University? (related keywords to this question: `#neuroscience`, `#neuromarketing`, `#Brain-Computer Interaction`, `#affective engineering`, `#UX engineering`, ...)

- **Subtopic 3**: AI/robot technologies are getting rapidly developed. Let's suppose that the AI can perfectly measure human emotions based on our bio-signals, facial recognition, and behavior analysis; also emotionally responses to you like a real human (based on computer algorithms, of course!). What are positive and negative thoughts of your about a computer/device/robot's emotional reaction to you? (Did you perhaps watch the movie, 'Her'?) Provide your arguments/opinion that what are positive/negative effects of the human-like robot/computer in people's daily life.


#### Topic 7. [4-2. Emotional Ergonomics II: Emotional Design]
Watch the [videos listed in **4-2 Emotional Ergonomics II**](HFE04_2.md), then write an essay including the following subtopics.

- **Subtopic 1. Summary**: Summarize what you've learned from the videos. Use "bullet points" for listing important keywords and short sentences. Don't exceed one page for a summary.

- **Subtopic 2**: How can human emotion affect human behavior? Let's think about some good or bad examples on which emotion can make people doing good actions or hesitating. How can a design help people have a good emotional status? (keyword: `#positive emotion`, `#positive design`)

- **Subtopic 3**: How do you think about the power of positivity? Get this [Design for Happiness Cardset](https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid:22a4e066-a1ab-468c-bd78-6c2c3e39e064/datastream/OBJ/download) by clicking the link. Then, by referring to the keywords (e.g., `#amusement`, `#confidence`, `#courage`, `#dreaminess`, `#energetic`, `#fascination`, `#hope`, `#joy`, `#kindness`, `#love`, `#pride`, `#satisfaction`, ...) showing in the cardset, provide some ideas on how to make people being more positive by a new product/service. (For example, how to make people amused?)


#### Topic 8. [5-1. Usability I: Design with Users & Usability Evaluation]
Watch the [videos listed in **5-1 Usability Engineering I**](HFE05_1.md), then write an essay including the following subtopics.

- **Subtopic 1. Summary**: Summarize what you've learned from the videos. Use "bullet points" for listing important keywords and short sentences. Don't exceed one page for a summary.

- **Subtopic 2**: The USER needs to be importantly considered in product development. Why? What can be happened if the USER (e.g., their needs/wants, their working environment/situation, their physical/cognitive/emotional characteristics, ...) is not appropriately considered in a <font color="blue">product</font> development process? What are the benefits of involving users in the product/service development process? There are many reasons/aspects, which might result in a product successful or fail. How is 'usability' important for the product's success? Do you know any success or failure story? (keywords: `#user-centered design`, `#design with users`, `#co-design`, `#usability`, `#usability evaluation`)<br><font color="blue">(Note) "product" mentioned in this question widely includes various types of the produced things such as ICT devices, home appliances, crafts, meals, designs, equipment, facility, buildings, home, interior, software, smartphone app, ...</font>

- **Subtopic 3**: How to know about the user? There are many methods and ways of having a connection to users. Explain some methods of how to meet users. Also, describe the usability (use + ability) and usability testing (or usability evaluation). How is usability evaluation different from the user needs survey?


#### Topic 9. [5-2. Usability  II: User-Centered Design Principles]
Watch the [videos listed in **5-2 Usability Engineering II**](HFE05_2.md), then write an essay including the following subtopics.

- **Subtopic 1. Summary**: Summarize what you've learned from the videos. Use "bullet points" for listing important keywords and short sentences. Don't exceed one page for a summary.

- **Subtopic 2**: Based on the knowledge of "INCLUSIVE DESIGN", discuss how HUMAN is different from USER. (in other words, how can you distinguish differences between "HUMAN-centered" and "USER-centered")

- **Subtopic 3**: Everybody knows that user-centered design is important. And UCD is one of the success factors in business. But, how-to-design is a different story. There are general guidelines for the user-centered design (e.g., `#simplicity`, `#affordance`, `#mapping`, `#consistency`, `#flexibility`, `#structure`, `#constraints`, `#tolerance`, `#feedback`, ...), but the specific considerations are all different by product. Provide different examples (two or three), which require different considerations for the increment of own usability.
